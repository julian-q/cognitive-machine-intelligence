<p><b>Mission</b></p>
<p>
Our goal is to foster discussion and research in human-inspired cognitive artificial intelligence at Stanford HAI through interdisciplinary collaboration. Cognitive AI represents a crucial frontier in AI research, and we are motivated by human cognitive capacities that outperform AI, and the prospects of unlocking new capabilities in machines to think or learn to solve tasks such as cognitive or logical reasoning, physical understanding, planning, motor control, and others. We invite individuals from diverse backgrounds that are passionate about bridging the gap between human cognition and AI, including but not limited to computational and cognitive sciences, electrical engineering and computer science, neuroscience, psychology, and linguistics. Through our speaker series and reading group, we aim to combine insights from various fields and extend our understanding to tackle questions that drive forward the development of AI systems that can match or exceed human performance across a broader range of cognitive tasks.

<ol>
<li>
Instilling cognition in machines
<ul>
<li>so what do humans do well that machines/AI systems struggle at?</li>
<li>can machines/AI systems learn from us?</li>
<li>whatâ€™s difficult about this? what is the current horizon, and what do we need to get there?</li>
<li>Applications: physical scene understanding, concept learning? thinking both fast and slow. etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Enhancing human-machine collaboration
<ul>
<li>on the other side, what do machines do well that we can leverage / utilize?</li>
<li>if they can think like us, can they infer our goals, beliefs, thought processes?</li>
<li>can we enhance communication / collaboration through this? (e.g. sample efficient, less human attention / effort)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Towards human-machine alignment
<ul>
<li>suppose they do. where do we go from there?</li>
<li>can we ensure safety?</li>
</ul>
